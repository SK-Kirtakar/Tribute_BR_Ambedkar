				<h2>1st Minister of Law and Justice</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar</b>(Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar: 14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist,
					economist, social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from
					the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru,
					and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism. <br><br>
	
					After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics at Columbia
					University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was
					among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s. He also trained in the
					law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was
					marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing
					journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment of
					the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits. <br><br>
	
					In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The
					salutation Jai Bhim used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb, meaning
					"Respected Father".
